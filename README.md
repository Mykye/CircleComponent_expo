## Circle Spinner Component

This is a React Native component that displays a circle divided into an arbitrary number of sections.
Users can interact with it by spinning the circle with their finger (on mobile) or mouse (on the web).
The circle provides tactile feedback upon interaction and displays which section stops at the 12 o'clock mark after spinning.

## Usage

The `Circle` component accepts a `numSections` prop to specify the number of sections in the circle.

```javascript
<Circle numSections={6} />
```

## Interaction

- Users can spin the circle by touching it (on mobile) or clicking and dragging (on the web).
- The circle continues to move for some time after the user releases it, emulating inertia.
- Tactile feedback is provided upon interaction.
- After the spinning ends, the component displays which section stopped at the 12 o'clock mark.

## Props

- `numSections`: The number of sections in the circle.
